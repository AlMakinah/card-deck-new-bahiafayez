## Exercise

Create a class called **Card** and **CardDeck** which would represent a real deck and all possible properties and methods.

### Card

- A Card would have a suit (Spades, Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts) and a rank (1 -> 13)

### Card Deck

- A Card Deck has a list of Cards
- You can shuffle a deck
- You can peek (get the value of the card on top of the deck)
- You can deal (return the value of the card on top of the deck. It is removed from deck afterwards)
- You can get the size of the deck (the number of cards in the deck)

Make sure all the tests are passing.
